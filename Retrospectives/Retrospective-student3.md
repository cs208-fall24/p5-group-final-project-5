## Experience

Working on implementing the comments feature with create, edit, and delete functionality using SQLite was the fun part of the project. I improved my skills in datatbase management, and rendering dynamic views with Pug. Collaborating with the team over Git made the process smooth, allowing us to manage code changes effectively and work together.
