## Experience
This was a fun lab, I like that I could do the webpage however I wanted. I wish I had more time to dedicate to work on this because
I think there is a lot more potential for the site to be better. I wanted to add a slideshow using javascript to display 
some images but I couldnt get it figured out in time. I had lots of trouble trying to merge, in the time of writing this I still
havnt gotten it to work for me. But I am ahving lots of fun learning new things, which I did through this project. I didnt have many 
issues with the code, most of it is recycled from the to-do list or other projects throughout the semester. I used Chat GPT quite a 
bit to help me with CSS because that is something I am not the most knowledgeable in. I also couldnt figure out how to make it so 
the user can properly use the back arrow in the browser, I have put buttons myself to navigate but this could be better.
I think that I have a way better understanding of how webpages and databases communicate, this project will also be useful for 
me to use in the future as reference to look back at when making webpages in the future.
