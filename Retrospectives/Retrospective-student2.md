## Experience

This project was really easy - at first. The first week, I finished my fisrt page in about 30 minutes, and I thought I was doing really well, but then came the server stuff. I had understood the libraries in play in the previous assignment, so I did not think it would be much harder, but working with other people and multiple sub folders, I was at a loss initially and still donâ€™t fully understand the linking process. In traditional javascript you have to add the whole relative path to the file you want to access, but in this, it was solely the file and maybe a parent folder if there were multiples of that file name. This was really confusing, but what was more confusing was when I tried to use libraries not listed in the json file, because they did not work. I could not import them in the normal way, and they were very basic functions I wanted to access like prompt and even just a document function did not work at one time. This was extremely frustrating, and slowed down development significantly. I did eventually figure out the function I had access to, though, and was able to complete the given tasks after that fairly easily. If I were to do this project again, I would have communicated more with my partners to make things look more polished in the end, and get past minor obstacles like missing libraries.

## Known issues or Bugs

The images are comically large, but that's an issue not a bug. Other than that, I haven't run into anything.
